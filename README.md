# Computer-Vision-Project

The project evaluates 8 deep learning models including UNet, ResNet, SegNet, GoogleNet(Inception V3), VGG, AlexNet, R-CNN, Vision Transformer (ViT), and EfficientNetV2. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, precision-recall curves, and overall robustness. The experiments are conducted in the Kaggle environment, leveraging its GPU support and pre-hosted datasets.
